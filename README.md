Initiate Project: 

npm install 
npm install -g json-server

first terminal: npm start
second terminal: json-server --watch ./src/assets/data/db.json


Components folder: 
- I am keeping all blocks in components folder and in components folder I have helpers where I keep hamburgerMobile, media-query, WindowScroll for the sticky header. 
- For the whole application I used styled components and react-ui-kit which helped me to buid footer very quick and also mdReact which is a boostrap library whoch helped to with columns and rows. 

- TestimonialBlock is getting data from Json database that I created localy, therefore you need to run json-server in order to see the block .
I used contextApi to store my data which are distributed with provider across my application (provider is in app.js wrapping all blocks)

- Block_001 is an reusable block across the app. 

- The app is fully responsive with a nice hamburger menu. 

I will finish this app fully as per design in the future as it was really fun to build it.
